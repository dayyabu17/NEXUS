### 4.3 System Testing Overview

The system testing phase focused on validating the Nexus Campus Event Management System as a complete, integrated entity. This process employed a "Black Box Testing" methodology, evaluating the system’s functionality by examining inputs and outputs without reference to the internal code structure. This approach effectively simulated real-world user behavior, ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements and functions correctly from an end-user perspective.

Testing was conducted in a deployed environment, utilizing both Localhost and Vercel hosting platforms to mirror production conditions. To verify cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness, the application was rigorously tested on modern web browsers, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, across a variety of devices. This included validating the user interface on different screen sizes, ranging from standard laptop displays to mobile devices, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience for all users.

End-to-end validation was a critical component of the system testing strategy, covering the complete user lifecycle. The testing workflow followed the user journey from initial Registration and Login to Event Discovery, Ticket Purchase, and finally, Post-Event Feedback. This comprehensive approach ensured that data consistency was maintained across all modules and that the integration between the frontend, backend, and external services (such as Paystack and Distance Matrix AI) functioned flawlessly throughout the entire process.

In addition to functional verification, the system underwent performance and security checks. Performance testing involved monitoring load speeds and latency to ensure acceptable response times during user interactions. Basic security measures were also validated, specifically verifying that role-based access controls were enforced, effectively preventing non-administrative users from accessing restricted areas such as the Admin Dashboard.
