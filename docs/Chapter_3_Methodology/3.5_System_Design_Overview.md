# 3.5 System Design Overview

The system design phase for the Nexus Event Management System translates the high-level functional and non-functional requirements into a concrete technical blueprint. Whereas the requirements analysis phase captured *what* the multi-vendor marketplace must accomplish for guests, organizers, and administrators, the design phase specifies *how* the solution will be constructed across software layers, data structures, and integration touchpoints. This blueprint guides implementation, facilitates communication among developers, and provides a defensible artefact for academic review.

Nexus adopts a layered client-server architecture backed by the widely used Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. On the client side, a React single-page application renders interactive views, manages local navigation, and orchestrates user-driven workflows such as event discovery or checkout. The server side, implemented with Node.js and Express, exposes RESTful endpoints that encapsulate controller logic, enforce business rules, and delegate persistence to MongoDB models. This separation of concerns improves maintainability and allows each tier to evolve independently while exchanging data via JSON over HTTPS.

The MVC abstraction is honoured throughout the stack:
- **Models** encapsulate domain entities such as `User`, `Event`, and `Ticket`, providing schema enforcement, validation, and data access conventions through Mongoose.
- **Views** correspond to the React components that present organizer dashboards, guest tickets, or administrative reports.
- **Controllers**—implemented as Express route handlers—mediate between incoming HTTP requests and the underlying models, coordinating external services such as Paystack and shaping server responses for the client.

Subsequent subsections expand on this blueprint. Section 3.5.1 describes the proposed workflows and dynamic behaviour using activity, sequence, and use case perspectives. Section 3.5.2 details the architectural layers and core classes, while Section 3.5.3 focuses on the logical data model and supporting schemas. Together, these artefacts articulate how Nexus satisfies its campus event management objectives with a robust MERN-based implementation.
