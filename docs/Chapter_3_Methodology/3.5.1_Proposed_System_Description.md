# 3.5.1 Proposed System Description

The proposed Nexus platform supports a multi-sided community in which campus organizers publish events, guests discover and purchase tickets, and administrators oversee platform governance. The system combines responsive client interfaces, secure transaction processing, and role-specific dashboards to deliver a cohesive experience. The following textual descriptions outline the dynamic behaviour that would be captured in the formal UML and BPMN artefacts accompanying this chapter.

## Activity Diagram Narrative: Buying a Ticket
The “Buying a Ticket” activity begins when an authenticated or guest user accesses the event discovery interface. The guest browses or searches events, filters by category or location, and then selects a specific event card. After reviewing event details, the guest initiates the checkout process, which prompts for ticket quantity and confirms pricing. The system transitions to a payment stage where the guest is redirected to Paystack’s secure gateway or presented with an embedded payment widget. Upon successful payment authorisation, Paystack returns a positive callback to the backend, which records the transaction, increments RSVP counts, and generates a unique QR-coded ticket. The flow concludes by updating the guest dashboard with the new ticket and notifying the organizer of the purchase. Exception branches handle payment failure, seat unavailability, or user cancellation, redirecting the guest back to the appropriate step.

## Sequence Diagram Narrative: Checkout Interaction
The sequence diagram highlights synchronous and asynchronous calls among the **Guest**, **React Frontend**, **Express API**, **MongoDB**, and **Paystack**. The guest submits a checkout request through the React component, which issues an authenticated `POST /tickets/purchase` call to the Express API. The controller validates ticket availability, creates a provisional ticket document in MongoDB, and requests a payment authorisation from Paystack by forwarding metadata such as amount, reference, and callback URL. Paystack responds with an authorisation URL that the frontend uses to redirect the guest. After the guest completes payment, Paystack triggers the backend callback endpoint, enabling the Express controller to verify the transaction status, update the ticket record to `confirmed`, store the payment reference, and emit a confirmation response. The frontend subsequently polls or receives the confirmation, refreshing the guest’s ticket wallet and rendering a QR code for on-site verification.

## Use Case Overview
The use case model involves three primary actors:

- **Guest**: browse events, search by category or location, view event details, purchase tickets, access QR codes, and receive notifications.
- **Organizer**: authenticate into the dashboard, create and publish events, manage event media and pricing, monitor ticket sales, scan or validate attendee QR codes during check-in, and respond to feedback.
- **Admin**: approve or reject submitted events, manage user roles, audit transactions, and oversee platform-wide notifications or disputes.

Core platform use cases therefore include *Browse Events*, *Filter Map View*, *Create Event*, *Update Event Status*, *Purchase Ticket*, *Verify Payment*, *Scan Ticket*, and *Generate Reports*. Each use case maps back to specific REST endpoints and UI modules, ensuring coverage of stakeholders’ expectations documented in earlier requirements sections.
