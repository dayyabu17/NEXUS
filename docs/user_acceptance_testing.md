# 4.3.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was conducted with a group of 5 actual students and 2 organizers to validate the system's usability and user experience (UX). The goal was to ensure that the system meets the end-users' needs and that the interface is intuitive for key tasks such as event discovery, booking, and management.
